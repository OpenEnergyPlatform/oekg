# Open Energy Family - Open Energy Knowledge Graph (OEKG)
## Introduction
The Open Energy Knowledge Graph (OEKG) is a knowledge graph based on the [Open Energy Ontology (OEO)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology) with the aim of 
* representing and describing energy studies and scenarios in a structured, unified and flexible, as well as machine readable way
* allowing semi-automated qualitative and (partially) quantitative comparisons of studies and scenatio projections
  
It contains a network of entities, their semantic types, properties, and relationships for the energy system analysis domain. It is based on the [RDF standard](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) and uses the [Turtle format](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/). <br>
The OEKG will be integrated via the so called study and scenario factsheets on the [OEP](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform). It will be possible to populate the OEKG via adding and editing factsheets. Querying the OEKG will be possible via a SPARQL Endpoint.
